* [Chapter 0: HTTP, GET requests, HTML]()  
  Here let's do a quick HTML 
* [Chapter 1: Study the site, and get a list of movies]()  
  Before we scrape the top movies, we have to find a list of them. We can do that in one request . This is really easy as long as there are some consistent patterns to the page.
* [Chapter 2: Let's get details about one movie]()  
  I want to see how much money the top 100 movie made. . 
* [Chapter 3: Let's put all the code together, add loop magic]()  
  Now we have all 100 movies. Hooray!
* [Chapter 4: Selenium]()  
  I wonder if top grossing movies also have the best reviews (it sounds obvious but is it really?). Let's do some interactive web scraping with Selenium.
